    <string name="explanation">When the FAB is pressed two thread will execute code asynchronously.
        The main thread will update the progressbar at the top each second during 10 seconds.
        The background thread will update the progressbar in the bottom each second during 10 seconds.
        You can see how this is done simultaneously but in different threads. If this was not done at the same time,
        then what would happen is that the main thread would end first and then the background thread will start.
        If you are looking a for a quick AsyncTask exercise this is the right place. Maybe you notice a small delay in the
        background thread, that it is cause sleeping and waking up a thread is not instantaneous</string>
